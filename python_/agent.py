''' NOTE: agent functionality
The purpose my agent mostly is to handle states creation,
level matrices, identifying levels, performance evaluation etc.
Training, loading, deleting, saving, etc. are handled by
the model itself.
TODO: So I should cobine agentHelpers and create an agent class.
TODO: I still need these methods to control the model from agent! I must initiailize a model somewhere.
